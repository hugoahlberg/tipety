codepath application


this is my application for Codepath. 

Time spent: maybe 2 hours spent in total, including the time it took to watch the tutorial video

Completed user stories:
I'm not sure what these stories you are refering to are..?
 
 
Notes:
How can I make the keyboard, or input field to be active, from the start of the app? (would be nice not having to tap to begin but just start typing)

Walkthrough of all user stories:
Coming soon.
